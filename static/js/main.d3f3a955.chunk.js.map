        Laurel Schwulst talks about how important it is for the web to be free and should be an outlet for individuals to express themselves in \"my website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge\". She talks anout how important it tis for the people to take back the web from big, self serving corporations that have practically taken over the web. I find that I sympathize with these ideas. I always admired the artistic and freeform quality of the web. It is such an important platform that can be shaped and painted to reflect any person. Furthermore, I really like how the author likens the creation of a website to that of a room, or plant or a shelf. Personally, I think when I make a website, it is a combination of building it as a \"puddle\" and as a \"room\". I often find myself creating websites in large bursts of inspiration, rather than, periodic, constant change like a puddle. I also tend to rearrange my website like I would rearrange my room. moving large parts of it around until I find some harmony in its combinations. I had never given much thought to these varying approaches of making a website before, and I realize how different minds can work.\n                </p>\n                <p style={{ margin: \"50px\", textAlign: \"left\" }}>\n                    The second article, in shocking contrast to the first, focuses on some of the oldest, most static but best practices of web design.

However, these not so amazing websites are the building blocks of the web; The core of a good and sound website before all of its added embellishments. The authors emphasis of these less flashy but critical web design practices surely made me question my own lacking form. I tend to jump to the fun and colorful aspects of the website, thinking to leave the smaller html design practices for last, or considering them optional. However while the website mahy appear nice, on the inside, it is susceptible ti breaking and would result in future problems.\n\n                </p>\n                <p style={{ margin: \"50px\", textAlign: \"left\" }}> The Jodi website at first glance is what I would consider web art.

At\n          first I just had shuffling decks but noticed the topic of dealing was\n          there. Do I need to deal cards? If so, do I need to deal them amongst\n          a variable number of players? Should I be able to return the cards?\n          Should I keep dealing until the cards run out? Should I single dealing\n          of cards? There was so many things I could do, I wasn't sure about the\n          requirements. So I decided to keep it simple and just allow for\n          shuffeling and one time equal dealing of cards.\n        </p>\n        <p style={{ margin: \"50px\", textAlign: \"left\", fontSize: \"20px\" }}>\n          I actually learned a lot from thsis project than I thought. I was\n          stuck on this bug that I absolutely could not figure out. Dealing out\n          cards and shuffeling worked fine. However, I could not reset my deck\n          of cards. There would be cards missing everytime I dealt cards. The\n          cards I dealt were not returning to the deck. WHY????? I made a\n          variable to store my state of cards. I had seperate decks for dealing\n          and a fresh deck to reset my deck on click. BUT WHY WAS MY FRESH DECK\n          MUTATING? I never made any calls to deal from my fresh deck. I only\n          made calls to my dealing Deck, my deck should be untouched.

Coming from C++ I had no idea, that I was just referencing the\n          same array every time I set a new variable to that array of cards. I\n          needed to do a full on deep copy of my array!!! After figuring that\n          out, my code worked as expected.

I see the first game is\n          showing me the system of life of working 9-5 for some company and\n          climbing ranks and the second, the life of being my own boss after\n          creating my own startup. I guess I learned, both of them suck, but I\n          hate the first one less. The second game had me frustatrated, mainly\n          becuase I had no idea how to run a business, sell myself and invest. I\n          cant seem to secure spots in the market and therefore I cdon;t have\n          revenue therefore I cant hire or keep my current employees happy. It\n          felt like I was stuck in a cycle of making constant risks. The first\n          game in contrast, while it was more mundane, I simply had to do my\n          assigned tasks and I will get promoted. Sure there was less\n          excitement, byt it was honest, good work.\n        </p>\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default Blogs;\n","import React, { Component } from \"react\";\n\nclass Assignement7 extends Component {\n  state = {};\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <div style={{ textAlign: \"left\", margin: \"50px\" }}>\n        <h1>The Circle of Life System</h1>\n        After watching the LIon King, I decided to think of the circle of life\n        as a system. In more scientific terms, how energy created and is passed\n        throughout the ecosystem.\n        <div>\n          light -> plants -> primary consumers -> secondary consumers ->\n          tertiary consumers -> Quartenary consumers -> decomposers All of them\n          release heat.\n        </div>\n        The food pyramid would show us that each organism consumes to recieve\n        energy.
