She talks anout how important it tis for the people to take back the web from big, self serving corporations that have practically taken over the web. I find that I sympathize with these ideas. I always admired the artistic and freeform quality of the web. It is such an important platform that can be shaped and painted to reflect any person. Furthermore, I really like how the author likens the creation of a website to that of a room, or plant or a shelf. Personally, I think when I make a website, it is a combination of building it as a "puddle" and as a "room". I often find myself creating websites in large bursts of inspiration, rather than, periodic, constant change like a puddle. I also tend to rearrange my website like I would rearrange my room. moving large parts of it around until I find some harmony in its combinations.
