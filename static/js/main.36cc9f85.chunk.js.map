        Laurel Schwulst talks about how important it is for the web to be free and should be an outlet for individuals to express themselves in \"my website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge\". She talks anout how important it tis for the people to take back the web from big, self serving corporations that have practically taken over the web. I find that I sympathize with these ideas. I always admired the artistic and freeform quality of the web. It is such an important platform that can be shaped and painted to reflect any person. Furthermore, I really like how the author likens the creation of a website to that of a room, or plant or a shelf. Personally, I think when I make a website, it is a combination of building it as a \"puddle\" and as a \"room\". I often find myself creating websites in large bursts of inspiration, rather than, periodic, constant change like a puddle. I also tend to rearrange my website like I would rearrange my room. moving large parts of it around until I find some harmony in its combinations. I had never given much thought to these varying approaches of making a website before, and I realize how different minds can work.\n                </p>\n                <p style={{ margin: \"50px\", textAlign: \"left\" }}>\n                    The second article, in shocking contrast to the first, focuses on some of the oldest, most static but best practices of web design. We can see the skeleton of most old wesbites, and they look like copies of eachother with various texts. However, these not so amazing websites are the building blocks of the web; The core of a good and sound website before all of its added embellishments. The authors emphasis of these less flashy but critical web design practices surely made me question my own lacking form. I tend to jump to the fun and colorful aspects of the website, thinking to leave the smaller html design practices for last, or considering them optional. However while the website mahy appear nice, on the inside, it is susceptible ti breaking and would result in future problems.\n\n                </p>\n                <p style={{ margin: \"50px\", textAlign: \"left\" }}> The Jodi website at first glance is what I would consider web art. I really love seeing the web utilized it creative ways, and this website did that. Every link I clicked showed me something unexpected, and it had a way of drawing me in, even though I could not understand it. The use of colors, characters, animation and images, strewn together in a clever way makes traversing through the website a fun and exciting journey.</p>\n                <h2 style={{ margin: \"50px\", textAlign: \"left\" }}>Inspector Tools practice</h2>\n                <p style={{ margin: \"50px\", textAlign: \"left\" }}>\n                    Using the inspector tools I was able to make various changes on youtube.com.

In summary, I have changed font family/sizing/colors, background and icon colors, added borders and played with padding through a variety of means using the inspector tools.\n                </p>\n                <div style={{ padding: \"50px\" }}>\n                    <img style={styles} src={require(\"../../images/a1-4.png\")}></img>\n                    <img style={styles} src={require(\"../../images/a1-1.png\")}></img>\n                    <img style={styles} src={require(\"../../images/a1-2.png\")}></img>\n                    <img style={styles} src={require(\"../../images/a1-3.png\")}></img>\n\n                </div>\n\n                <p style={{ margin: \"50px\", textAlign: \"left\" }}>\n                    Over here, I also worked on editing w3 schools wesbite.

At\n          first I just had shuffling decks but noticed the topic of dealing was\n          there. Do I need to deal cards? If so, do I need to deal them amongst\n          a variable number of players? Should I be able to return the cards?\n          Should I keep dealing until the cards run out? Should I single dealing\n          of cards? There was so many things I could do, I wasn't sure about the\n          requirements. So I decided to keep it simple and just allow for\n          shuffeling and one time equal dealing of cards.\n        </p>\n        <p style={{ margin: \"50px\", textAlign: \"left\", fontSize: \"20px\" }}>\n          I actually learned a lot from thsis project than I thought. I was\n          stuck on this bug that I absolutely could not figure out. Dealing out\n          cards and shuffeling worked fine. However, I could not reset my deck\n          of cards. There would be cards missing everytime I dealt cards. The\n          cards I dealt were not returning to the deck. WHY????? I made a\n          variable to store my state of cards. I had seperate decks for dealing\n          and a fresh deck to reset my deck on click. BUT WHY WAS MY FRESH DECK\n          MUTATING? I never made any calls to deal from my fresh deck. I only\n          made calls to my dealing Deck, my deck should be untouched. My array\n          is const, I am necer edititng the array, how could it be altered?\n        </p>\n        <p style={{ margin: \"50px\", textAlign: \"left\", fontSize: \"20px\" }}>\n          After a few hours I finally found my bug. Doing \"const freshDeck =\n          cards\" and \"const dealDeck = cards\" does NOT create a copy of an\n          array. Coming from C++ I ahd no idea, that I was just referencing the\n          same array every time a set a new variable to that array of cards. I\n          needed to do a full on deep copy of my array!!! After figuring that\n          out, my code worked as expected.

I would say this article kind of\n          rained on my parade, as I used to look at new technologies and ideas\n          with excitement and possibility, but now I might have to look at it\n          through a more critical lens.\n        </p>\n\n        <h3 style={{ margin: \"50px\", textAlign: \"left\" }}>\n          Julian Oliver, Stealth Infrastructure\n        </h3>\n        <p style={{ margin: \"50px\", textAlign: \"left\", fontSize: \"20px\" }}>\n          This reading was interesting as I had never really given much thought\n          to cell phone towers before. Even if I had, I don’t think I would\n          really be thinking about the dangers of cellphone towers or cell\n          phones. Seeing stories of people, for example, the guy who accused\n          Motorola of giving him a tumor, was surprising. My phone has always\n          been something I keep close to my heart, and like a mother, I refuse\n          to imagine it could hurt ever hurt me. Sure there was that debaccle a\n          few years ago with Samsung Galaxy Note’s exploding, but it was a risk\n          I was willing to take. I think, regardless of all the fears people\n          have of their privacy being invaded, or the potential dangers of radio\n          signals and whatnot, people will still use phones. People have always\n          done things that are detrimental to their health, like alcohol, drugs,\n          extreme sports etc. because they enjoy it more than they fear it.\n        </p>\n\n        <h3 style={{ margin: \"50px\", textAlign: \"left\" }}>\n          Louise Drulhe, Critical Atlas of Internet\n        </h3>\n        <p style={{ margin: \"50px\", textAlign: \"left\", fontSize: \"20px\" }}>\n          This was an interesting read. Though the font was slightly hard to\n          read, I did enjoy the stroked dotting of the “i” as well as the whole\n          viewing experience with the scrolling and images. Thinking about the\n          internet as a single point and how it connects the world gives me a\n          different perspective. The ability of the internet to connect everyone\n          globally is grand, but I can’t help but think about all the actual\n          physical architecture we have built to make it possible. Afterall, we\n          literally have gigantic cables running from here to halfway across the\n          world to connect everyone. In that sense, to me, the internet is not\n          just a single point, but a jumble of threads that everyone is\n          entangled in.\n        </p>\n\n        <h3 style={{ margin: \"50px\", textAlign: \"left\" }}>\n          Kate Crawford and Vladan Joler, Anatomy of an AI System\n        </h3>\n        <p style={{ margin: \"50px\", textAlign: \"left\", fontSize: \"20px\" }}>\n          It was nice delving into the “mind” of my Google Home. Training\n          systems with a flood of updated images and data makes you think about\n          all the possibilities in AI. One concept that stood out to me was the\n          idea that “media is not an extension of human senses-but rather an\n          extension of the Earth”. This is a perspective I am not used to.\n          Usually I read about AI and technology or Web 2.0 in relation to how\n          closely they can mimic the human mind. But now that I think about it,\n          the media indeed can be a natural process of Earth. Transfer of\n          information particles that change in structure through sound waves or\n          devices made from natural elements.

Being a\n          millenial American, it's hard for me to imagine censorship of the web\n          and justification of this censorship, especially when it comes to\n          political, goverment nad human rights issues. But I have to understand\n          that there are manhy countries that have gone out of their way to\n          create new browsers, apps and technology to control and hide things\n          from the public. Allowing banal content like cat memes apparently is\n          something higher powers had no choice but to allow, as the people\n          would find their ways to do. Containing more sensitive topics in a way\n          seems easier, as many people were less relcutant to go against\n          censorhip whhen their internet and services became faster.\n        </p>\n\n        <h3 style={{ margin: \"50px\", textAlign: \"left\" }}>\n          Paul Ford, i had a couple of drinks and woke up with 1000 nerds\n        </h3>\n        <p style={{ margin: \"50px\", textAlign: \"left\", fontSize: \"20px\" }}>\n          This article was an interesting read.

I think in the modern world,\n          censorship is often seen as a bad thing, atleast that woul dbe my\n          shallow opinion of it. On one hand I recognize the difficulty of\n          identifying the location of a crime scene, as current technology isn't\n          catered to be very flexible of photos. Censoring photos gives a lower\n          chance of identifying the location. But the first photo of a sexual\n          abuse being censored makes me think, wouldn't the victim prefer to be\n          censored? A traumatic event, where the victim is in a vulnerable\n          state, probably isn't something anyone wants mass circulated across\n          the world. But finding closure is important too, which has a higher\n          chance if the crime scene can be identified.
