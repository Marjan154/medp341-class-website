          Laurel Schwulst talks about how important it is for the web to be free
          and should be an outlet for individuals to express themselves in "my
          website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge". She talks
          anout how important it tis for the people to take back the web from
          big, self serving corporations that have practically taken over the
          web. I find that I sympathize with these ideas. I always admired the
          artistic and freeform quality of the web. It is such an important
          platform that can be shaped and painted to reflect any person.
          Furthermore, I really like how the author likens the creation of a
          website to that of a room, or plant or a shelf. Personally, I think
          when I make a website, it is a combination of building it as a
          "puddle" and as a "room". I often find myself creating websites in
          large bursts of inspiration, rather than, periodic, constant change
          like a puddle. I also tend to rearrange my website like I would
          rearrange my room. moving large parts of it around until I find some
          harmony in its combinations. I had never given much thought to these
          varying approaches of making a website before, and I realize how
          different minds can work.

          The second article, in shocking contrast to the first, focuses on some
          of the oldest, most static but best practices of web design. We can
          see the skeleton of most old wesbites, and they look like copies of
          eachother with various texts. However, these not so amazing websites
          are the building blocks of the web; The core of a good and sound
          website before all of its added embellishments. The authors emphasis
          of these less flashy but critical web design practices surely made me
          question my own lacking form. I tend to jump to the fun and colorful
          aspects of the website, thinking to leave the smaller html design
          practices for last, or considering them optional. However while the
          website mahy appear nice, on the inside, it is susceptible ti breaking
          and would result in future problems.

          The cloud has always boggled my mind. The tech industry spends
          thousands and enlists thousands of people to work on the “cloud”, and
          so many of them are excited about it, but I just could not fathom it.
          This article has a darker twist on the cloud I had not considered.
          Most technology like the internet, was built for war purposes, and so
          this technology can very possibly be adjusted to use as a weapon.
          Considering this, it is not at all crazy to think that the cloud is a
          result of a more belligerent purpose. I would say this article kind of
          rained on my parade, as I used to look at new technologies and ideas
          with excitement and possibility, but now I might have to look at it
          through a more critical lens.

          This reading was interesting as I had never really given much thought
          to cell phone towers before. Even if I had, I don’t think I would
          really be thinking about the dangers of cellphone towers or cell
          phones. Seeing stories of people, for example, the guy who accused
          Motorola of giving him a tumor, was surprising. My phone has always
          been something I keep close to my heart, and like a mother, I refuse
          to imagine it could hurt ever hurt me. Sure there was that debaccle a
          few years ago with Samsung Galaxy Note’s exploding, but it was a risk
          I was willing to take. I think, regardless of all the fears people
          have of their privacy being invaded, or the potential dangers of radio
          signals and whatnot, people will still use phones. People have always
          done things that are detrimental to their health, like alcohol, drugs,
          extreme sports etc. because they enjoy it more than they fear it.

          This was an interesting read. Though the font was slightly hard to
          read, I did enjoy the stroked dotting of the “i” as well as the whole
          viewing experience with the scrolling and images. Thinking about the
          internet as a single point and how it connects the world gives me a
          different perspective. The ability of the internet to connect everyone
          globally is grand, but I can’t help but think about all the actual
          physical architecture we have built to make it possible. Afterall, we
          literally have gigantic cables running from here to halfway across the
          world to connect everyone. In that sense, to me, the internet is not
          just a single point, but a jumble of threads that everyone is
          entangled in.

          It was nice delving into the “mind” of my Google Home. Training
          systems with a flood of updated images and data makes you think about
          all the possibilities in AI. One concept that stood out to me was the
          idea that “media is not an extension of human senses-but rather an
          extension of the Earth”. This is a perspective I am not used to.
          Usually I read about AI and technology or Web 2.0 in relation to how
          closely they can mimic the human mind. But now that I think about it,
          the media indeed can be a natural process of Earth. Transfer of
          information particles that change in structure through sound waves or
          devices made from natural elements. This relates further convinces me
          that AI is more than just training models with data, but a result of
          labor, information and natural resources.

          I always wondered how censorship worked in other countries. Being a
          millenial American, it's hard for me to imagine censorship of the web
          and justification of this censorship, especially when it comes to
          political, goverment nad human rights issues. But I have to understand
          that there are manhy countries that have gone out of their way to
          create new browsers, apps and technology to control and hide things
          from the public. Allowing banal content like cat memes apparently is
          something higher powers had no choice but to allow, as the people
          would find their ways to do. Containing more sensitive topics in a way
          seems easier, as many people were less relcutant to go against
          censorhip whhen their internet and services became faster.

          This article was an interesting read. A lot of the web niw is so
          homogenous. When I think of the web, I think of pages I can open on
          the browser. This article reminded me that there is a whole world out
          there of technial creativity and fun that existed before web 2.0.
          While they seem old fashioned or unfamiliar to modern people, web art
          can be done with raw code in your own termnal.

          The Are.na I feel is a different platform, one that I am not used to.
          I never even imagined that people could uniquely categorize blocks of
          information, and define themselves. People can create definitions of
          concepts that cannot normally be boxed under any existing definition.

          This article made me feel conflicted. I think in the modern world,
          censorship is often seen as a bad thing, atleast that woul dbe my
          shallow opinion of it. On one hand I recognize the difficulty of
          identifying the location of a crime scene, as current technology isn't
          catered to be very flexible of photos. Censoring photos gives a lower
          chance of identifying the location. But the first photo of a sexual
          abuse being censored makes me think, wouldn't the victim prefer to be
          censored? A traumatic event, where the victim is in a vulnerable
          state, probably isn't something anyone wants mass circulated across
          the world. But finding closure is important too, which has a higher
          chance if the crime scene can be identified. I wonder whats more
          important?
