        <h1>The Circle of Life System</h1>
        After watching the LIon King, I decided to think of the circle of life
        as a system. In more scientific terms, how energy created and is passed
        throughout the ecosystem.
        <div>
          light -> plants -> primary consumers -> secondary consumers ->
          tertiary consumers -> Quartenary consumers -> decomposers All of them
          release heat.
        </div>
        The food pyramid would show us that each organism consumes to recieve
        energy. The circle of life system is affected by:
        <ul>
          <li>Population Size</li>
          <li>Region</li>
          <li>Weather</li>
          <li> Pollution</li>
          <li>Types of species and the populations of each of those</li>
          <li>Death</li>
          <li>Birth</li>
          <li>Consumption</li>
        </ul>
        This system is incredibly complex, especially if we think of it in terms
        of a food web, so it's diffuclt to completly map out. Becuase of this I
        probably won't do this for my final project
      </div>

export default Assignement7;
